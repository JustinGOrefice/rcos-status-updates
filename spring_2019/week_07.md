<h2>Last Week's Accomplishments</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I finally fixed the tables, and I am currently waiting for Varun to approve it. I changed the formatting a bit so it more resembles an html table, and then I implemented a similar table to the one found on the admin page. Now all the columns except for the image colum can be sorted by clicking the column header at the top, and can be sorted in ascending and descending order. </p>
