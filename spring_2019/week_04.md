<h2>Last Week's Accomplishments</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week, I wrote the code for bug #511, which should sort the submitions by all the column titles. All I need to do is add it to the repository. To fix the bug I created a table in HTML on JSFiddle and wrote code to sort each text column and it is called by clicking the column header.

<h2>This Week's Plan</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week I plan to add the code to the repository and probably get a new bug to fix.  </p>
