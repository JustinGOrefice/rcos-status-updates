<h2>Last Week's Accomplishments</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week, I got Venue to successfully run on my computer after dealing with installation problems with mongodb. Now Mongodb, Node, Gulp, and npm all work on my computer. I also went through the mozilla tutorial on JavaScript, and I believe I have a proficient understanding to start working on the JavaScript parts of the project. The tutorial covered the folowing topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction
<li>Grammar and types</li>
<li>Control flow and error handling</li>
<li>Loops and iteration</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Expressions and operators</li>
<li>Numbers and dates</li>
<li>Text formatting</li>
<li>Regular expressions</li>
<li>Indexed collections</li>
<li>Keyed collections</li>
<li>Working with objects</li>
<li>Details of the object model</li>
<li>Using promises</li>
<li>Iterators and generators</li>
<li>Meta programming</li>
 </ul>

<p>I uploaded my final project from the tutorial to my repository. I also created a web application with both a front and back end using a tutorial on Angular, and I feel like this really helped me learn. It went over the following:
<ul>
 <li>The Hero Editor</li>
 <li>Displaying a List</li>
 <li>Master/Detail Components</li>
 <li>Services</li>
 <li>Routing</li>
 <li>HTTP</li>
</ul>
 </p>

<p>I downloaded Markdown as well, and it seems to be working. </p>

<h2>This Week's Plan</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week I plan to learn Express and MongoDB and potentially add them to my Angular project if applicable. I also plan to look at the bugs in Venue and pick one to work on fixing. </p>
