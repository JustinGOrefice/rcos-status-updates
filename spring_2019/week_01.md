<h2>Last Week's Accomplishments</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week, I got Venue to successfully run on my computer after dealing with installation problems with mongodb. Now Mongodb, Node, Gulp, and npm all work on my computer. I also went through the mozilla tutorial on JavaScript, and I believe I have a proficient understanding to start working on the JavaScript parts of the project. The tutorial covered the folowing topics:</p>
</blockquote>

<p> * Introduction
* Grammar and types
* Control flow and error handling
* Loops and iteration
* Functions
* Expressions and operators
* Numbers and dates
* Text formatting
* Regular expressions
* Indexed collections
* Keyed collections
* Working with objects
* Details of the object model
* Using promises
* Iterators and generators
* Meta programming</p>

<p>I uploaded my final project from the tutorial to my repository. I also created a web application with both a front and back end using a tutorial on Angular, and I feel like this really helped me learn. It went over the following:
* The Hero Editor
* Displaying a List
* Master/Detail Components
* Services
* Routing
* HTTP</p>

<p>I downloaded Markdown as well, and it seems to be working. </p>

<h2>This Week's Plan</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week I plan to learn Express and MongoDB and potentially add them to my Angular project if applicable. I also plan to look at the bugs in Venue and pick one to work on fixing. </p>
